/*
The scripts here are from the Irrlicht Engine but used to simplify some few math elements.
In fact only vector2D, Vector3D and Quaternions are used but the other scripts seem to be dependencies (quite a lot of dependencies but not my design...)
All credits go to their authors: http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/

TODO: Replace by own implementation or get rid of dependencies.
